# osl-nodes
The OSL code I make is only tested with Isotropix Clarisse.
It is thus designed for Y up axis coordinates in mind.

## Interior Mapping Shader

| interior_mapping.osl |
|-|
| Room mapping with custom depth and horizontal/vertical scale |
| 4 modular layers, with custom depth and hozizontal/vertial offset |
| Global texture flop for the room, individual texture flop for each layers |
| Testing texture template included |


Code is never clean enough, so if you have a better implementation, feel free to commit.
